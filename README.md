# Adressing User Retention issue: Finding Key Metrics to inspire new players to Improve
We are analyzing what the key metrics are in determining a win in league of legends, so that Riot Games can better prepare its new players to face senior players with a sense of direction.

Riot games's League of Legends has a problem attracting new players to stick with the game. Senior Developers were publicly saying just months ago that the player base is aging, with fewer new players jumping into the game. At over 100 million monthly users, they stand to lose a lot from this if the trend keeps up. 

League of Legends is widely considered to have a steep learning curve. As the League of Legends community ages, it gets progressively harder for new players to get into the game, especially against older players. As a free-to-play game offering zero means to outright buy a competitive edge over another player, most of the game's profits come from skins and other visual accessories.  it needs a large player pool to remain profitable, and new players help the most with this. This project seeks to identify key metrics for new players to focus on, so they do not get lost in a huge wave of information, with simple targets to work towards, making the game more beginner-friendly. After all, how do you improve at a game when you have no idea what to improve on? You could learn all the basic skills to be a 'good' player, and still not know where to focus your efforts in the actual game. Many are concerned with League of Legends' player base being mainly older players who are now in or entering their twenties. For the future, we should focus on new-player experiences to retain profitability. What metrics should new players work on to improve at league of legends instead of quitting out of frustration and loss of direction?

**Insights**: **Team objectives have the biggest correlations with win rate in the dataset by far**, followed by total number of deaths of a player. Specifically, number of dragons was the single highest correlated factor out of over dozens of factors. The tutorial in League of Legends completely skips the teamplay aspects of the game, and completely misses all information about the jungler, one of the five roles in the game. This is significantly hindering the new player experience. Coincidentally, the jungler role is also the role responsible for securing team objectives such as the dragon. The tutorial, however, only teaches how to kill opponents and interact with towers to destroy them, a very small part of the game. In fact, learning how to use escape abilities is much more vital as the correlation between deaths and wins was almost twice the correlation for kills and wins. According to the data, staying alive has a much bigger likelihood of leading to a win than does having a relatively high kill count. It is shocking that the totorial does not teach the timing or windows for securing team objectives since they most often lead to wins, and instead choose to not mention them, or the role responsible for them, at all. **Newer players are receiving no information on how to take actions that highly coincide with winning games, and do not even know of the role that secures team objectives, leaving a very wide information gap between them and older players**. This is surely contributing to the steep learning curve of the game, and taking away from the game's overall profitability.

Analysis: I decided to analyze **data from season 15 (January-December 2025) from Riot Games API** on the European server. These are from real games and are publicly available through Riot Games. This data is across all ranks for the most popular 5v5 game mode, "Summoner's Rift" and features the same number of wins as losses. I analyzed factors such as kills, deaths, and team objectives for their correlation with win rate, as well as the win rate when conditions were met in a given game. A Factor that many players take pride in, champion-mastery level on a champion, was found to have almost 0 correlation with win rate (0.027). However, the highest correlation factor with win rate was not kills but was actually the number of dragons killed by your team that game (correlation of 0.58), signaling that this single factor was affecting win rate the most. The runner-up is the number of barons slain by the team (0.42), both of which are team objectives. Surprisingly, the number of personal deaths in a game (-0.39) had a much stronger correlation than kills did (0.275). Shockingly, with around 68,000 rows of player data for games, dying a low number of times almost skyrocketed the win percentage in the data set. Looking at the data, dying less times alongside focusing on major team objectives (dragons and barons) seems to be the most reliable way to win a game, as opposed to going for many player kills and tons of mastery (which you gain every time you play a champion) on a single champion.

Solution: The tutorial is very short and goes over too little information, only highlighting destroying towers and killing the nexus, the main objective of the game. The importance of Dragons, barons, and other team objectives like rift heralds is non-existent because of this, at least from a new-player perspective. The importance of dying less is also not mentioned at all, which is odd considering it is one of the fastest ways to lose a game of League and leaves your towers and base undefended. These concepts should be incorporated and highlighted in the actual tutorial for the game, as they have a high impact on win rate. Given the information, I see no reason not to include them in the tutorial, or at the very least, highlight their importance so that new players focus on team objectives and the dire consequences of dying and leaving towers undefended. The current state of the tutorial offers no information on either. It does not mention how to perform the role of the 'jungler', which is the role tasked with securing team objectives in the game. With such a big part of the game missing, it is no wonder people have such a hard time learning the game. Go over situations where it is viable and advantageous to spend time taking team objectives, and highlight the team-wide buffs they give. This can be **a seperate part of the tutorial, where players learn to push waves and/or get kills in order to safely secure a timing window to secure the dragon with their jungler**. Skipping over an entire section and an entire role of the game to rush players into matches does not help new players compete. **A second solution involves showing players key averages for improvement, such as a few of the ones above. A more sophisticated approach would include average gold per minute, kills, and deaths for their specific rank, as well as average dragons and barons killed per game for their specific rank**. New players could vastly benefit from knowing which benchmarks other players are hitting in their games, so they know what they are relatively strong and weak in comparison. There are many third party add-ons that achieve this, which are mostly only known to veteran players. The key here is to shorten the knowledge gap between the newer players and the older ones to make a more enjoyable experience while players are initially learning the game to increase user retention rate.
